# Habitat
Habitat is an application developed to provide the user with an accurate and quantitative comparison of quality of life in cities across Canada. 

This application was developed as a final project for the course CS 2XB3 and was worked on by 5 team members including myself. My role in the creation and development of the project was Lead Developer, which encompassed aiding with the design, programming a large part of the project, overseeing the work being done by other members as well as putting together the final implementation of the project.

Included documentation: Design & Requirements Specifications and project log
